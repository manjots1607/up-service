# UP SERVICE
## Provide Best Service to your customer by handling calls using this web app and assigning tasks from customer calls to engineers.

Up Service is built on top of express JS and node JS and I used mongo DB as database for this project.
This project helps businesses to provide best service to their customers as it manages calls received through customers by call center executive if issue is not solved it is passed to engineer by default exec can choose from engineers having lowest number of pending calls and after that engineer has two option either close or pass call to another engineer if he is unable to solve issue.

There is also admin role who can view various stats and creating id's of new CC Exec's and Engineers.
